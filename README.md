# Fungi Paradise

## About
Alfonso is a genius biologist who loves to eat various kinds of mushrooms every day. One day he was eating mushrooms while reading the news and he found an article in the Smithsonian Magazine website titled “You May Have Been Eating Mushrooms That Were Unknown to Science”. According to the article, many mushrooms, including some we eat every day, are still unknown to science and may be poisonous or harmful to our health. Since he eats many mushrooms every day, Alfonso got scared and shared the article with his biologist colleagues. His biologist colleagues then asked our team, TWICE Spiderman (a team made up of Esteban Ariza, Johan Sebastián Giraldo, Juan José Restrepo and Mateo Valdés), for help.
The biologists say that we must first read the data already available regarding the mushrooms. Furthermore, the biologists advise us to make graphs and charts about all the available data in order to get a better grasp of the information. They advise us to make graphs of edible vs. poisonous mushroom quantity, the number of mushrooms with a certain odor, number of rings in each of the mushrooms, number of bruises in each of the mushrooms, and the number of mushrooms with a certain cap color. Finally, they want us to use all of the information and determine, given any mushroom’s attributes, whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous. They say that if we do this Alfonso will be able to enjoy mushrooms again without feeling scared and crying.
